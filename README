4chan archiver

== Apologies ==
This is *crappy* Perl code (but it seems to work).


== Dependancies ==
Not a lot but on an Ubuntu system you may need to install:
- libhtml-tokeparser-simple-perl


== Usage ==
$ perl 4chanarchiver.pl https://boards.4chan.org/b/thread/XXXXXX/thread-name

Before using, check the output path (by default I put it in /tmp/4chan).
The script will create a sub-directory using the thread title extracted
from the URI, and fill it with the pictured grabbed from the thread.


== Output ==
A lot of NSFW pictures.


== TODO ==
* A bit of parallelism (to grab multiple files at a time)
* More generic code to easily handle other chans (/b/ is supported here)
* Handle existing files
* Auto-refresh to grab new content
* Better code :)
* But I won't do that, since I didn't want to maintain this code :)
